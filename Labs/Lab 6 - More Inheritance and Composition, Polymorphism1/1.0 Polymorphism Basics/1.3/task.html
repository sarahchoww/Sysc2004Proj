    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Polymorphism Basics~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will be an introduction to polymorphism in Java. It will also provide more practice in inheritance and
        composition. Lab 7 will provide more detail and more advanced concepts relating to polymorphism in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved via <strong>method overloading</strong> and
        <strong>method overriding</strong>. What does this mean? At a high level, polymorphism refers to an object's
        ability to take on "many forms". I.e., an object of a particular class can also behave as if it were a member of
        another class.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.3~</h3>
    <p>
        Even though we override the superclass method, we may still want to call upon its functionality. We can do this
        using <code>super</code>, which was presented in Lab 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modify the classes as necessary so that the correct output is produced. Do not modify <code>Main.java</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Correct output:<br>
        <code>I am: Jim<br>
            I am: Kevin<br>/I like to: Count Seconds<br>
            I am: Jeanine<br>/I like to: Ski<br>
            I am: Maurice
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        What would happen if you removed <code>aMethod()</code> from the Child class and ran the code again?
