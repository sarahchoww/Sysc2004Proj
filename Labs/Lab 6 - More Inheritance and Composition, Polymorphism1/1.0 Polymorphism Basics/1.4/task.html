    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Polymorphism Basics~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will be an introduction to polymorphism in Java. It will also provide more practice in inheritance and
        composition. Lab 7 will provide more detail and more advanced concepts relating to polymorphism in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved via <strong>method overloading</strong> and
        <strong>method overriding</strong>. What does this mean? At a high level, polymorphism refers to an object's
        ability to take on "many forms". I.e., an object of a particular class can also behave as if it were a member of
        another class.
