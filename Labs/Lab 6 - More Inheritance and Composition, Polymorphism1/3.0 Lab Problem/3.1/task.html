        <p>
            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>
        </p>

    <h3>~Problem 3.1~</h3>
    <p>
        In this problem you will be coding the PostWall class.
    </p>
    <p>
        A PostWall object is composed of (or an aggregation of) many Post objects. These Post objects should be arranged
        in a vertical fashion, separated by a divider.
    </p>
    <p>
        PostWall has some methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>generate()</code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This method should generate the current "wall" made up of all the posts contained in the PostWall
                    object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It should be printed out vertically, by calling each Post's <code>display()</code> method. Posts
                    should be separated by a divider.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>addPost()</code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This method must take a Post object and add it to the PostWall's list of Posts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remember, a post can be any of the above Post subtypes (VideoPost, MessagePost, PollPost).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
