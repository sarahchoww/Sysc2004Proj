    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>

    <h3>~3.0 Lab Problem~</h3>
    <div class="preamble">
        <p>
            You must submit your solution to this problem on CuLearn.
            <strong>
                YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND STUDENT NUMBER IN COMMENTS AT THE
                HEAD OF EVERY FILE YOU SUBMIT
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong><u><i>ONLY</i></u></strong> the files specified at the end of this big red box. The files
            and code within should be completed according to the specifications made <i>throughout</i> the Lab, and only
            the final versions should be submitted. I.e., if Task 55.23 tells you to add accessor methods to MyClass,
            you are required to include that code if MyClass needs to be submitted as part of the solution to the
            Lab Problem (<strong>unless</strong> a later Task or the Lab Problem state otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not include redundant methods. Do not include methods that are not asked for or necessary. Some Lab
            Problems will not explicitly state you need accessor methods, but these methods may be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have learned how to document code, you need to document your classes for full marks!
            <strong>This is applicable from Lab 4 until the end of the course.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to complete the problem in this environment, the files can be
            retrieved by right-clicking '3.0 Lab Problem'>Show in Files/Explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Submit <strong>Post.java</strong>, <strong>PostWall.java</strong>, <strong>VideoPost.java</strong>,
            <strong>PollPost.java</strong>,
            <strong>MessagePost.java</strong>, <strong>Comment.java</strong>
            when you are done.

    <h3>~Problem 3.1 (continued)~</h3>
    <p>
        This is Problem 3.1 continued. You will be coding the VideoPost, PollPost, MessagePost, Comment classes.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to determine which of these classes should subclass Post. Feel free to completely refactor the Post
        class to make effective use of method overrides and overloads. You can assume an instance of Post will never be
        used in the PostWall, i.e. it will always be a VideoPost, PollPost, or MessagePost. In the future, Post would be
        a good candidate for an interface. In general, you should always code against an interface when implementing your
        polymorphic behaviour. But this is a topic for a future lab.
    </p>
    <p>
        While inheritance is a viable strategy for this lab, composition could be a better solution. We will stick to
        inheritance for this lab because we want to be able to handle Post objects in a polymorphic manner within the
        PostWall class (we want to be able to call <code>display()</code> across all Posts on the wall).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Comment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This is a class that will be used to model comments. Comments get displayed on other posts, never
                    on their own.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Comment has a message (could be <code>content</code>), an <code>author</code>, and a
                    <code>time</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Comment cannot be commented on. A Comment cannot be reacted to.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>VideoPost:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This subtype of Post is very similar to its superclass. A disclaimer
                    should be displayed above the <strong>entire</strong> post (i.e. on top of it). The disclaimer
                    should say "VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED" if it is set when the VideoPost is instantiated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Content in a VideoPost will be a url. These should simply be Strings.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>PollPost:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This subtype of Post is different in that it can be "reacted" to in two ways. This post should still
                    be displayed with the emoji counters, but users can also submit a String answer. These will
                    typically be a single word and can be anything!
                </li>
                <li>
                    A PollPost should have a poll question and answers to the poll question as its content section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Notice the answers contain a count next to them, and they are not sorted. You can use the
                    StringIntPair class provided to simplify your collection of poll answers in PollPost.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>MessagePost:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This subtype of Post should essentially be the Post class you created in section 2.0. It should have
                    a message as <code>content</code> and display identically to the Post class from section 2.0.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
