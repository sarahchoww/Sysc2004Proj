    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Polymorphism Basics~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will be an introduction to polymorphism in Java. It will also provide more practice in inheritance and
        composition. Lab 7 will provide more detail and more advanced concepts relating to polymorphism in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved via <strong>method overloading</strong> and
        <strong>method overriding</strong>. What does this mean? At a high level, polymorphism refers to an object's
        ability to take on "many forms". I.e., an object of a particular class can also behave as if it were a member of
        another class.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.1~</h3>
    <p>
        How can an object behave like two different classes? This is where inheritance comes into the equation. An
        object can only share behaviour with another class in its inheritance hierarchy.

        In <code>Main.java</code> there is an array containing several objects, of type Parent and Child. What do you
        think the code will produce as output?
