    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~2.0 The Post Class~</h3>
    <p>
        In this section you will be building the Post class that will form the basis of this lab's Lab Problem.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 2.1~</h3>
    <p>
        The Post class models a post that you might see on a social media website. There will be a number of different
        types of posts (PollPost, VideoPost, MessagePost) which will all derive their basic behaviour from
        the Post class. These posts can be added to the PostWall for public viewing.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Post should have an <code>author</code>, <code>time</code>, <code>content</code>, a list of
        <code>reactions</code>, and a list of <code>comments</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Post should have a single constructor that takes in the <code>author</code> and <code>content</code> and
        initializes the other fields to some default values (empty list, 0, empty string, etc.). <code>time</code>
        should be set to the current time (it never changes). For help on this consult:
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html#getTime--">Oracle Docs: Calendar</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        <code>reactions</code> must keep track of the "reactions" users have to a post. These are limited to all of the
        basic human emotions, namely: =), =|, =(, =O -
        there are only
        four possible reactions. You can copy these emojis into your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you may have realized, <code>comments</code> will be Comments. To avoid errors for now, you will need to
        create a Comment class. A Comment should have an <code>author</code>, <code>content</code>, and a
        <code>time</code>.
