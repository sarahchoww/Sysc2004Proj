    <h1>Lab 6 - More Inheritance and Composition, Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>Authors: <strong>Martin Klamrowski</strong>, <strong>Cristina Ruiz Martin</strong></p>
    <p>Relevant textbook reading - <strong>Chapter 7</strong> (The Object Oriented Thought Process)</p>
    <h3>~1.0 Polymorphism Basics~</h3>
    <p>
        This lab will be an introduction to polymorphism in Java. It will also provide more practice in inheritance and
        composition. Lab 7 will provide more detail and more advanced concepts relating to polymorphism in Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved via <strong>method overloading</strong> and
        <strong>method overriding</strong>. What does this mean? At a high level, polymorphism refers to an object's
        ability to take on "many forms". I.e., an object of a particular class can also behave as if it were a member of
        another class.
    </p>
    <h3>~Task 1.5~</h3>
    <p>
        The previous examples demonstrated method overriding. In Java, we can also overload methods. Unlike method
        overriding, which occurs between superclass and subclass, method overloading can be done between superclass and
        subclass and within the same class.
    </p>
    <p>
        To overload a method we must specify different parameters but have the same method name. Method overloading
        enables us to have methods with the same name, but different parameters and return types. This is also what is
        meant by overloaded constructors: different constructors with different parameters and parameter types.
